## Side projects

- If you don't have work experience, work on some small tech projects you can highlight at the top of your resume as proof of your skills
- These don't have to be big or take too long to do! It's totally okay to make something assignment sized that takes less than a week of work, or a few hours on a weekend.
- If you don't feel like you have the skills to make something yet, or don't have any ideas, you can take a short online course that involves a project!
- Projects are important when you don't have work experience yet, but they're not as essential once you have work experience on your resume
- **PLEASE PLEASE please don't spend all your time on coding projects unless that's just how you like to spend your time** you don't have to do side projects to be successful even though it often is talked about as if you do

If you do happen have a lot of time on your hands that you want to spend on side projects, and have something in particular you'd like to work in that you don't have experience in yet, then [Chris Cates](https://github.com/ChrisCates) suggests that you can work on a big project to gain experience. For example:

1. Say you want to work in AI
2. You could choose to do research on Tensorflow.
3. You could fork a Tensorflow project from GitHub (look up "fork Github" on Google if you're not sure what that means) and write a wrapper for a specific neural network technique (Alexnet for example).
4. You could then write a blog post, website demonstrating processes, methodology and use case for the technique.
5. You can then apply to relevant companies, showcasing he project and case study as an informal cover letter.

I've never done this. That's more technical work outside of school/jobs than I'd want to do. But it does work for some people!

But know that you don’t have to build something super fancy complicated. You can create something through a course (like this [Udacity web development course](https://www.udacity.com/course/web-development--cs253)) or make a game like hangman or build a calculator or whatever else you can think of. You’ll be surprised how complicated “simple projects” can be and how much you can learn. That’s what employers want to see.
